Hello everybody,

As I stepped into the area of mono imaging with the new ASI 1600 MMC I had to change my software for imaging. Additionally I was looking for a new private project to work on when it's cloudy and I thought heck why not building that new software all by myself :D

Now after some cloudy weekends of programming I am satisfied with the first version and thought about sharing it with you all. (Hoping that everything works on other machines, too :undecided: )

This project will be an open source project under the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.

You can download the setup here: https://bitbucket.org/Isbeorn/astrophotographybuddy/downloads/AstrophotographyBuddy.zip
Source code can be found here: https://bitbucket.org/Isbeorn/astrophotographybuddy/src

Feel free to use it, but keep in mind that this is a personal project of mine and if you run into issues I cannot guarantee to fix them. Anyway I appreciate every suggestion for improvement!


System Requirements
64-bit Windows 7 or later
.NET Framework 4.5 or later
ASCOM Platform 6.2 or later

Features
All Equipment connected via ASCOM
Monochrome camera control
Temperature control (including a cool down routine for a set amount of time)
Set up sequences for imaging
Dithering (via PHD2)
Dithering after a set amount of images
Auto-Stretch image
Image manipulation with gamma, brightness & contrast sliders 
Filter wheel control (either manually or automatically during imaging)
Basic control of telescope movements
Macros to set up custom file names
Supported Image formats: FITS & TIFF
Fully customizable UI colors for both Night mode and Daylight mode

Known Issues
Color Cameras are not supported yet (that's not a priority for me as I only have mono cams)
PHD2 Listener sometimes not getting the settle finish event or even loses connection. Just reconnect and it should work fine again.
When setting up a custom image file name which is not unique an existing file will be overwritten
Not all controls apply every custom UI color

HowTo
Top Buttons (from left to right):
Menu button: Activates/Deactivates the menu overview to select a specific screen
Left arrow button: Cycles to the previous screen
Four arrows button: Activates/Deactivates the overview screen which will give you an overview about the current image, sequence, temperature and guide graph. Personally I use this when everything is running.
Camera button: Opens a dialoge to choose the ASCOM Camera
Filter wheel button: Opens a dialoge to choose the ASCOM filter wheel
PHD2 button: Tries to connect to the PHD2 Server
Telescope button: Opens a dialoge to choose the ASCOM telescope
Eye button: Toggle color mode. Will swap to the alternative colors set up in the options screen
Right arrow button: Cycles through the next screen
Camera Screen:
Camera: Basic information about the camera
Camera Infos: Special info about the camera
Filter wheel: when connected shows a list of filters to choose frome. When clicking on an item in the list the filter will be changed to the selected one
Temperature control: Left side gives you info about the current temp and target temp. Additionally you can activate the cooler
                                  Right side: choose a target temp and a duration (duration is optional). Click on the check button to run the cooldown. If no duration is selected the chosen temperature will be set directly
Diagrams: A brief history about the cooler power and camera temperature will be displayed
Imaging Screen:
Sequence Setup: Click the + button to add an additional sequence. Click into the sequence grid to edit the sequence parameters.
                             #: Number of images to take
                            Time: Exposure time
                            Type: Type of your image
                             Filer: Combobox to select the desired filter (will be populated when a filter wheel is connected (default: filter won't be changed)
                            Binning: Select a binning mode out of available modes (default: 1x1)
                            Dither: If checked, dithering will be triggered
                            Dither Every # Frame: If you want to dither only after # frames you can set that up there
Histogram: Shows a histogram of the current image
Play button: Will start the sequence
Bottom left:  Controls to take a single exposure.
Wand toggle button: Activates/Deactivates Auto-Stretch

Frame & Focus Screen:
Images which are triggered from this screen will not be saved to disk!
Zoom slider: Zoom out or into the image displayed below
Bottom part: Similar to bottom left part of Imaging screen except that the image will not be stored to disk.
Right part: Basic control for brightness, contrast and gamma. Slide to desired values and click the check button (this feature is experimental and not very fast currently)

Telescope Screen:
Information: Basic information about Telescope and position
Control: Move telescope to displayed directions by the set rate. Additionally there is an option to park the scope.

PHD2 Screen:
Status: Status of PHD connection
Guide Graph: Similar to the guide graph in PHD2. Will be displayed in pixel scale.

Options Screen:
Save Image As: Desired output format. Supported are TIFF and FITS - TIFF will be stored in 16 bit and is faster
Image File Path: Select a folder where your images should be stored
Image File Pattern: Choose an image pattern. The available macros are listed below
PHD2 Settings: Set the Url and Port for your PHD2 Server and the amount of pixels to be dithered
UI Colors Current/Alternative: Define the UI colors for the daylight and night mode

Hope you guys enjoy it, and more features will come over time!

PS: I'm not sure if this is the right sub-forum, feel free to move it to the proper one.
