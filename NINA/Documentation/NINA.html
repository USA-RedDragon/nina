            <li>Screenshots with NINA in 1280×720 (minimal window size) resolution to maintain readability</li>
            <li>Screenshots annotation with Greenshot to have the same numbering scheme</li>
            <li>Screenshots of UI in “Arsenic” as primary style, Dark as secondary style</li>
            <li>Use lots of screenshots in general, it’s easier to look at something instead of reading something, but do not skimp on text either</li>
            <li>Use ASCOM Simulators for Screenshots when possible</li>
            <li>Use the latest version of NINA, possibly the nightly builds if available (ask Isbeorn or darkarchon or build it yourself)</li>
            <li>Only add paragraphs to functionalities you used yourself to prevent guesswork</li>
            <li>Maintain an easy reading style so people who are completely new to the topic won’t get lost</li>
            <li>Viewers can only comment on entries, if you feel something is wrong comment on that specific section and it will be reviewed</li>

        <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
        <p>Welcome to NINA - Nighttime Imaging ‘N’ Astronomy. If you have found this document you have likely already downloaded the software - congratulations for that step!</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>NINA is a software designed for all DSO imagers. If you are totally new to the world of DSO imaging or a seasoned veteran our goal is to make your image acquisition easier, faster and more comfortable.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>NINA supports a wide range of cameras, mounts and accessories. This is achieved by utilizing the powerful ASCOM platform. The software allows you to connect all of your devices in one place and interconnects them in ways to make your imaging workflow as simple as possible, while still maintaining a high degree of customization.</p>
        <p>From control of mounts, cameras, focusers and filter wheels to detailed information about your current image with detection of HFR of your stars, useful statistics to determine your exposure time, auto stretching your image results over support for polar alignment, focus, framing, plate solving and target selection as well as generating powerful reusable sequences - this software has it all.</p>
        <p>This document is aimed to describe the functionality of NINA so you can utilize it to its fullest potential. It is divided into three rough chapters: <a href="#quick-start-guide">Quick Start Guide</a> to get you started, <a href="#tabs">Tabs</a> for full functionality, and <a href="#usage">Advanced topics</a> which should cover everything you need to know to effectively run the software. Should you have questions, issues, want to help development or just want to chit chat with us feel free to join the <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/fwpmHU4">Official NINA Discord</a> or record your findings in the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/Isbeorn/nina/issues?status=new&amp;status=open">official Issues Tracker</a>.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Important notes will appear like this throughout the documentation, if you happen to find a note like this don't skimp over it!</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Please note that images in this manual might not 100% reflect what you see, they will only be updated for a specific section if there actually were some updates in this version.</p>

        <p>Once you start NINA for the first time you will be greeted with this screen. Let’s go over the basics for a moment to accustom you with the usage of this software.</p>
        <p><img src="images/quickstart-ui-overview.png" alt="Quickstart UI Overview" /></p>
        <p>The UI is divided in 2 panes. On the left side tabs section (1) you will find all the necessary tabs to connect your equipment, on the right side you usually find the detailed information about the currently selected tab. The currently selected tab is highlighted on the left side (1) so you always know where you are. Feel free to click through all of them; the detailed descriptions for all tabs are provided in the <a href="#tabs">Tabs section</a>. For now let’s assume you have a DSLR camera and mount with no filter wheel or any extras and just want to start a simple sequence.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>This quick start guide assumes you know how to connect your equipment to the computer and have the appropriate drivers for <a href="https://ascom-standards.org/">ASCOM</a> and your camera (if necessary) already installed. If you do not, don’t hesitate to ask us on the <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/fwpmHU4">official NINA Discord server</a>.</p>

        <p>Now let us focus on connecting your camera and mount for the first time.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>You should have physically connected your camera and mount to the PC NINA is running on already. If you did not, connect it now.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><img src="images/quickstart-camera.png" alt="Quickstart Camera Connection" /></p>
        <p>Now you need to select your camera in the drop down menu (1). If it does not appear in the list press the refresh button (2). If you are using a Nikon camera you need to select the general “Nikon” option from the drop down menu. Once you selected your camera press the Connect button (3) to connect the device.</p>
        <p>Once your device is connected it will display various information about the camera (if available) in the Camera section (4).</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Keep in mind that if you are using a DSLR the information might be incomplete or missing. That doesn’t deter NINA from working, but should you need to find the information you have to look for it online.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>When you connect a camera that has the ability to change the gain (ISO) it will be displayed in the Camera Settings section (5). This is the default gain that will be used and can be overridden by settings during imaging later.</p>
        <p>Once you connected your camera you will need to connect your mount. For that we have to switch to the telescope tab (6).</p>
        <p><img src="images/quickstart-telescope.png" alt="Quickstart Telescope Connection" /></p>
        <p>Here we have the same procedure to connect the mount as we have with the camera. Select the mount from the dropdown (1), refresh if not available (2), and press connect (3) to connect to the mount.</p>
        <p>In the Telescope section (4) you will find useful information about the latitude, longitude, elevation, sidereal time and when it will arrive at the meridian as saved in the driver/mount or calculated by NINA. You can manually slew to specific coordinates with (5) or control the mount manually in the Manual Control section (6).</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>This is very useful if you don’t use a hand controller anymore.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2 id="quick-start-finalizing-the-settings">Quick Start: Finalizing the settings</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>This whole setup routine only has to be done once for a specific profile. Once you have your default mount and camera set you just need to press the Connect button (7) once NINA is started up to connect to the saved equipment automatically.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>We have a few small steps to do before we can start with imaging. For that we need to switch to the Settings tab (8).</p>
        <p><img src="images/quickstart-settings-equipment.png" alt="Quickstart Settings Equipment" /></p>
        <p>In the settings we go directly to the Equipment tab (1) and have to set a few things first. You should set your pixel size to the pixel size that your camera has, if it has not been set automatically, which is the case with most DSLR. Search online for the pixel size of your camera and enter the value in (2).</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>If you have an older Nikon camera you might not be able to use the native bulb mode for long exposures (&gt;30s) via USB. If you have a RS232-Shutter cable or your mount has a shutter port which is connected to the camera change the setting in (3). Please refer to the Advanced topic <a href="#using-rs232-or-mount-for-bulb-shutter">using RS232 or mount for bulb shutter</a>.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Finally, you will need to set your Telescope or lens focal length in (4).</p>
        <p><img src="images/quickstart-settings-imaging.png" alt="Quickstart Settings Imaging" /></p>
        <p>Now we have to set a few other image saving related settings as well. To do that switch to the Imaging tab (1). The images can be saved as TIFF (with two different compression algorithms, too), XISF and FITS (2). TIFF is a solid format and this setting can be left unchanged. If you want to save space use a compressed TIFF format. Feel free to change it though should you prefer a different format. Next you need to set the Image File path (3). This is the place where your images will be saved. And finally, if you want you can change the Image File Pattern (4). This is how the images will be named after. You can see variables that you can use below the panel and with the button next to (4) you can check how your file pattern will look like. You can leave this setting on default or customize it as you like.</p>
        <p>Once you have done that we can move on to to focusing and starting a sequence.</p>
        <h2 id="quick-start-focusing">Quick Start: Focusing</h2>
        <p>To start imaging you first want to focus. For that, let’s switch to the Imaging tab (1).</p>
        <p><img src="images/quickstart-imaging.png" alt="Quickstart Imaging" /></p>
        <p>Once there, you will be greeted with this view. There is a lot of information and panels around, but in general it’s divided in two spaces. First, where you can view and interact with the panels (2) and a second where you can enable and disable various panels (3). Since we only use a DSLR and a mount let us disable disable a lot of those panels to get a better overview. Feel free to enable and disable your panels at will, in this example I will disable the following panels by clicking on their icon:</p>
        <p><img src="images/quickstart-disablepanels.png" alt="Quickstart Disable Panels" /></p>
        <p>You can leave those panels enabled, or disable any other at your will. Feel free to experiment around to see what you like. You can also drag the panels around inside the imaging window and rearrange and customize your look and feel. For tutorial reasons, I will leave that be for now.</p>
        <p><img src="images/quickstart-focusing.png" alt="Quickstart Focusing" /></p>
        <p>Since our target now is to focus our telescope to get pinpoint stars, we have to use the the following currently enabled panels.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>An alternative to focus is to use a Bahtinov Mask. You can try our experimental feature for Bahtinov Detection by enabling the icon in the <a href="#panel-image">Image panel</a>.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>With the HFR History (1) you will be able to see how your stars perform in terms of HFR. This is also represented in the Statistics panel (2). The lower your HFR value, the better focused your image will be. To start the manual focus procedure, you have to select the Imaging tab (3) and press on the start capture button (4). Your exposure time for that snapshot can be adjusted as well, should you choose to do so (5).</p>
        <p>To enable star detection and HFR analysis, you need to press on the Star Analysis button (6). This will yield a full analysis of the image and will enter the HFR values in the Statistics (2) and HFR History (1). You will notice that the AutoStretch button (7) will be enabled as well once you enable the Star Analysis button (6).</p>
        <p>Here are two examples of a focused and defocused star field.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="images/quickstart-focusedstarfield.png" alt="Quickstart Focused StarField" />
            <img src="images/quickstart-defocusedstarfield.png" alt="Quickstart Defocused StarField" />
        </p>
        <p>As you can see, the values for HFR have been entered in the HFR history and are displayed in the Statistics as well. The second image is definitely defocused with a HFR of 2.14, while the first image is in as good focus as possible. Your HFR values will vary because they depend on the focal length of the telescope as well as on the pixel size of the sensor, but you should try and focus your telescope until the HFR is as low as possible.</p>
        <h2 id="quick-start-starting-a-sequence">Quick Start: Starting a Sequence</h2>
        <p>Once you nailed your focus you can switch to the Sequence tab (1).</p>
        <p><img src="images/quickstart-sequence.png" alt="Quickstart Sequence" /></p>
        <p>Here we can find various options. For DSLR users it’s a relatively simple matter; enter the amount of images you want to shoot in Total # (2), enter the time for a single image (3) and the type (4), which likely will be LIGHT at that point. The type is only used for the file name pattern that we set in the settings and display on the user interface in the imaging tab. You may also change your gain for the sequence in the Gain column (6).</p>
        <p>With a press on the refresh estimated finish time button (5) you can see when the sequence is likely going to end. This value will change during the sequence depending on the average download time of your camera. Once you are satisfied with the sequence settings you can set a target name (7), which will be applied to the file name pattern as well. Finally press Start Sequence (8) to start the imaging sequence. From there on we will switch to the Imaging tab again (8).</p>
        <p><img src="images/quickstart-running-sequence.png" alt="Quickstart Sequence in Progress" /></p>
        <p>Here you will see some small changes about the status of the sequence. At the bottom left (1) you see the current status of the camera which will change depending on what it is doing. In the sequence tab (2) you will see the estimated finish time and information about the image that is getting shot currently. You can also pause or cancel the sequence prematurely using the two buttons at the bottom of the sequence tab. Finally in the Image History (3) you will see the past images you shot and you can open them from there to review them. From here on it’s waiting until your sequence completes. Good luck and clear skies!</p>

        <p>The imaging tab can be completely personalized to your wishes. You can enable and disable various panels or reposition them freely, designing the User Interface to your personal liking. The settings are stored and will be reused the next time you start NINA.</p>
        <p><img src="images/panel-customization_1.png" alt="Panel: Customization 1" /></p>
        <p>To start personalizing first you need to select the panel that you want to move. You can click and drag it either by the tab below it (see mouse cursor) or at the title bar to the left of the [x]. This action will detach the panel and give you following view:</p>
        <p><img src="images/panel-customization_2.png" alt="Panel: Customization 2" /></p>
        <p>As you can see the panel is free floating now and can be attached to various points marked with the red circles. You can move any panel this way to any position. This also allows you to split panels, for example here on the left side with the Plate Solving panel:</p>
        <p><img src="images/panel-customization_3.png" alt="Panel: Customization 3" /></p>
        <p>To split a panel move the new panel to the location where you want that split to be. Since I want to split the Plate Solving panel horizontally I move it to the bottom. Feel free to experiment with various splits and designs and change the imaging tab to your liking. After releasing the mouse button, you should have a layout like this:</p>

        <h2 id="plate-solving">Plate Solving</h2>
        <p>Plate solving is a great way to determine where your scope is pointing at exactly in the sky and an important aspect for fast and easy framing. Essentially what it does is taking a shot with your camera, extract the stars and tries to triangulate the current position based on an internal sky atlas of the plate solver.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>To utilize the full potential of plate solving it is required that your mount and camera are both connected to NINA.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <p>It is required that your camera and telescope settings in the <a href="#settings-equipment">equipment settings</a> are set correctly. The two important aspects are <code>Camera Pixel Size</code> for the camera and <code>Focal Length</code> for the telescope.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>NINA allows you to use the three most popular external plate solvers, each of which has its own benefits and drawbacks. Those plate solvers are Astrometry.Net, Local Astrometry and PlateSolve 2.</p>
        <h3 id="general-plate-solving">General Plate Solving</h3>
        <p>To plate solve an image you need to capture an image and use the <code>Plate solve current image</code> button in the <a href="#image-panel">image panel</a>. This will start the procedure of plate solving your image with the Plate Solver as set in the <a href="#plate-solving-settings">plate solving settings</a>. Should that plate solve attempt fail the mechanism will try to use the Blind Solver to solve the image.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Before being able to plate solve you need to configure the settings, primary solver and blind solver.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Should it happen that both plate solving mechanisms fail please verify that your image is somewhat in focus and if necessary change the exposure time or filter for that single image.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>To apply the plate solving you need to enable the options <code>Sync</code> and if you want to, <code>Reslew to target</code> in the <a href="#panel-plate-solving">plate solving panel</a>. The former will synchronize your mounts location to the location that the plate solver has determined you're at. The latter will reslew your mount to the location where it was supposed to be in the first place.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>This allows you to skip the whole star alignment process at your mounts start-up.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Plate Solving is also utilized in the <a href="#automated-meridian-flip">Automated Meridian Flip</a> to recenter your image after a flip has been performed. This is essential for a hands-off experience of NINA.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><em>Our recommendation is to set up all Plate Solvers to have a backup should one plate solver not work as expected in the field.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3 id="astrometry.net-plate-solver">Astrometry.net Plate Solver</h3>
        <p>The Astrometry.net plate solver will utilize the internet page Astrometry.Net to plate solve an image. It requires registration on <a href="http://nova.astrometry.net">astrometry.net</a> to get an API key that you need to enter in the settings.</p>
        <h4 id="benefits">Benefits</h4>
        <ul>

        <h3 id="local-astrometry-plate-solver">Local Astrometry Plate Solver</h3>
        <p>The local Astrometry plate solver is bundled with NINA and can be installed with the NINA setup. It requires download of index files which can be installed through NINA as well to get the required index files that you need for your combination of focal length and pixel size.

        <p>PlateSolve 2 is a standalone executable which can be downloaded from the <a href="http://planewave.com/downloads/software/">PlateSolve 2 home page</a>. It requires the download of at least one catalogue of stars so it can properly work. You need to start the executable once standalone and set the catalog location of the catalog that you want to use. Both the APM or UCAC3 catalogues will work just fine, but it is recommended to download both of them should you encounter issues with any one of them.</p>

        <h2 id="dithering-with-phd2">Dithering with PHD2</h2>
        <p>Dithering is an important part of the imaging process. The benefit of dithering will be a clearer image with less pattern noise and more detail since the image will be shifted by a few pixels with a dithering request.</p>
        <p>NINA supports dithering out of the box utilizing PHD2 and makes it easy to set up and have it running. There are a few prerequisites to be able to dither your images during a sequence.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A mount needs to be connected</li>
            <li>
                PHD2 needs to be be running, guiding and also connected to NINA
                <ul>
                    <li>The PHD2 settings in the <a href="#settings-equipment">Equipment Settings</a> need to be set up</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Dithering needs to be enabled in the sequence</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="phd2-settings">PHD2 Settings</h3>
        <p>You need to enable the Option &quot;Enable Server&quot; in PHD2 so NINA can connect to PHD2 to get the current guiding and RMS data as well as send dithering commands.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>The setting to enable it is in PHD2 under <code>Tools -&gt; Enable Server</code></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><img src="images/usage-dithering-settings-phd2.png" alt="PHD2 Settings" /></p>
        <p>The settings for NINA in the <a href="#settings-equipment">Equipment Settings</a> can be left at their defaults. The PHD2 Server Port of <code>4400</code> is correct and so is the the server URL of <code>localhost</code> since we assume PHD2 is running on the local computer.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>If you use a different computer to guide you need to change the server URL to the IP or Hostname of the guiding server.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The other two important settings are <code>Dither Pixels</code> and <code>Dither RA only</code>. You can leave the Dither Pixels to 5 or reduce it if you shoot at a high focal length. The default works fine for most focal lengths. It depends on the guide camera and focal length of the guidescope as well.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>You can calculate how much arcseconds a single pixel of your camera is by calculating the FOV of your guide scope with guide camera and getting the arcseconds per pixel values. A calculator for this is for example the <a href="https://astronomy.tools/calculators/field_of_view/">Astronomy Tools Field of View Calculator</a>.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Dithering RA only should be disabled in general so PHD2 will dither in all directions instead of only RA. If you have a high backlash and it takes a long time for the dither to settle, you can disable this option. This is generally not recommended.</p>
        <h3 id="sequence-settings">Sequence Settings</h3>
        <p>Once you have set up your PHD2 you will need to connect it first in the <a href="#tab-phd2">PHD2 Tab</a>. Once connected and verified that it sends data you can enable Dithering in the <a href="#tab-sequence">Sequence tab</a>.</p>
        <p><img src="images/usage-dithering-sequence.png" alt="Seqence Settings" /></p>
        <p>In the sequence tab you have two settings that affect dithering. The first and obvious is <code>Dither</code> for any given sequence entry. If you enable <code>Dither</code> PHD2 will start dithering every frame. You might want to consider dithering less than every frame or dither only for specific sequence entries. For example, if you use a LRGB rotational sequence (see: <a href="#advanced-sequencing">Advanced Sequencing</a>) you might only want to dither on every L frame. If you use a OSC Camera it is suggested to dither every frame.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>The dithering will happen while the camera downloads the image, so depending on how long your download is and how long it takes the guiding to settle you might not even lose time.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Once enabled in the sequence, the sequence is running and PHD2 is connected the dithering will happen automatically. You don't need to enable anything else.</p>

        <h2 id="automated-meridian-flip">Automated Meridian Flip</h2>
        <p>Automated Meridian flips are important once your mount passes the meridian while imaging. They prevent that your telescope and camera bump into the mount and do major damage to your equipment. NINA has built-in functionality for the automated flip, even if your mount does not support it in firmware.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Prerequisite for this functionality is that your mount is connected to NINA and the setting for flipping is enabled.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>To enable the Automated Meridian Flip you need to enable it in the imaging settings.</p>
        <p><img src="images/usage-autoflip-settings.png" alt="Automated Meridian Flip Settings" /></p>
        <p>There are a few settings that you can change here that will affect what the meridian flip will do.</p>
        <p>Minutes after meridian is when the flip actually will happen. 1 Minute as the default is a good time for the mount to actually notice it's past the meridian and flip automatically.</p>
        <p>Recenter after flip will use plate solving to determine where your mount is and recenter it after the flip.</p>
        <p>Scope settle time after flip will wait for the specified time after the flip and center.</p>
        <p>Pause before meridian is when the mount will stop imaging and wait for the time to pass until minutes after meridian.</p>
        <p>The whole Sequence of the Automated Meridian Flip works like this:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Camera shoots and downloads an image</li>
            <li>
                Check if next image time + time to meridian is less than pause before meridian
                <ol>
                    <li>If there is still time go to 1.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise continue with 3.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Show the Meridian Flip UI</li>
            <li>Stop guiding in PHD2 and mount tracking</li>
            <li>Wait until meridian passes + minutes after meridian setting</li>
            <li>Give a slew command to the same RA/Dec coordinates where it was before so the mount flips</li>
            <li>Start mount tracking</li>
            <li>Wait for Scope settle time</li>
            <li>
                If Recenter after flip is disabled go to 10.
                <ol>
                    <li>Otherwise take a snap shot and plate solve it</li>
                    <li>Recenter according to the plate solve to the correct mount location</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Auto Select star in PHD2 and resume guiding</li>
            <li>Wait for guiding to settle</li>
            <li>Continue with 1.</li>
        </ol>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Please note that some steps might fail or your mount can entangle itself during the automated meridian flip. <strong>Always supervise your mount and NINA while flipping to ensure that there are no issues.</strong></p>

        <h2 id="using-rs232-or-mount-for-bulb-shutter">Using RS232 or Mount for Bulb Shutter</h2>
        <p>If you have a DSLR that does not allow BULB exposure time over USB this is a solution for you. Instead of native USB mode you can use a selfmade RS232-Shutter cable or use the mounts port for shutter (if available). You can test whether you need or don't need an external shutter cable by trying taking an exposure of more than 30s. This will trigger bulb mode on DSLR. If your camera won't take a picture you need to look at this section.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Prerequsite for any method of this functionality is that your DSLR has a shutter port!</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>You can find the necessary settings in the <a href="#settings-equipment">Equipment Settings</a>.</p>
        <p><img src="images/usage-bulbshutter-settings.png" alt="Bulb Shutter Settings" /></p>
        <p>If your mount has a SNAP port we advise to test out the <a href="#mount-for-bulb-shutter">Mount for Bulb Shutter</a> functionality before the RS232 for Bulb Shutter.</p>
        <h3 id="rs232-for-bulb-shutter">RS232 for Bulb Shutter</h3>
        <p>One way to trigger the shutter mechanism of your DSLR is utilizing a self-made RS232 to Bulb shutter cable. There are already some pre-made cables to be bought online for this issue or you can DIY.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>DSUSB cables are not supported since they don't expose a COM Port!</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>You can find some tutorials on how to build a DIY shutter cable here:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.cloudynights.com/topic/457536-usb-corded-shutter-control-for-nikon/">Nikon MC-DC2</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.beskeen.com/projects/dslr_serial/dslr_serial.shtml">Canon #1</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.covingtoninnovations.com/dslr/CanonRelease.html">Canon #2</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you have a RS232-Shutter cable built you need to connect it to the PC, install drivers for your RS232 adapter and check for the COM port used.</p>
        <p>In NINA you need to select <code>Serial Port</code> for the Bulb Mode and change the COM port to the port your RS232 is using.</p>
        <p><img src="images/usage-bulbshutter-serial.png" alt="Bulb Shutter Serial" /></p>
        <p>After that you can try and snap an image with an exposure time of longer than 30s. If it works you are done and can now expose for any time that you wish.</p>

        </blockquote>
        <h3 id="mount-for-bulb-shutter">Mount for Bulb Shutter</h3>
        <p>If you are lucky enough that your mount runs with EQMOD and has a shutter port you can use that to trigger the bulb shutter mechanism.</p>
        <p><img src="images/usage-bulbshutter-mountsnapport.png" alt="Bulb Shutter Mount Port" /></p>
        <p>To try use that select the <code>Telescope Snap Port</code> from the settings drop down.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Currently confirmed and tested mounts for Mount Bulb Shutter are the SkyWatcher EQ6-R and AZ-EQ-6-GT.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>First you need to connect a shutter cable from the SNAP port of your mount to your DSLR. For that you will likely need a 3.5mm jack to your cameras specific shutter port cable.</p>
        <p>Once everything is physically connected you need to connect the mount to NINA and the Camera as well.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>If your mount has two SNAP ports you can use either. Both will work depending on the next setting.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The next step is to experiment with the command setting that is sent to the mount.</p>
        <p><img src="images/usage-bulbshutter-snapport.png" alt="Bulb Shutter Port Command" /></p>
        <p>The default settings might already work for you already, so feel free to try and take a snap shot that is longer than 30s in NINA. If the shutter is triggered, you are done and can take longer exposures than 30s now.</p>
        <p>Should this not work please try the commands <code>:SNAP2,1#</code> to start and <code>:SNAP2,0#</code> to stop the snap port.</p>
        <p>Should your bulb exposure still not trigger please contact us on our <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/fwpmHU4">Discord</a>.</p>
