<li>Canon: Fixed bulb mode for exposure times &lt;30s</li>
<li>Canon: All shutter speeds now correctly added when step set custom function is set to 1/3</li>
<li>Meridian Flip window does not get stuck anymore when clicking on cancel</li>
<li>Log Level will now be set on application start based on profile settings.</li>
<li>ASI Cameras will not shut down their cooling and progress on opening multiple instances of NINA</li>
</ul>

<li>Improved UI Style.
<ul>
<li>Tweaked some color themes for more consistent colors</li>
<li>Better spacing between elements to reduce wasted space</li>
<li>Two new background colors to better pronounce some ui elements</li>
<li>Reworked Imaging tab to have a common style.</li>
<li>Imaging tab tools pane (to hide/show panels) moved to the top and split into two separate categories</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Profiles don't get overriden when using multiple instances of N.I.N.A. with each one having a separate profile active</li>
<li>Autostretch replaced by a better midpoint transformation function</li>
<li>Autostretch now has black point clipping options</li>
<li>Vastly improved Image Statistics calculation.</li>
<li>Estimated Finish Time will automatically update in the sequencing view</li>
<li>Added copy button for existing color schemas to copy over to custom and alternative custom schemas</li>
<li>Framing tab:
<ul>
<li>Moved coordinates out of framing boxes to not obscure target</li>
<li>Added a new button to be able to add the framing target to a sequence instead of replacing</li>
<li>Control to adjust opacity of framing box</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improved Framing Assistant and Sequence Target Textboxes by giving up to 50 target hints based on input to select from</li>
<li>Framing Assistant now can annotate DSO</li>
<li>Attempt to start PHD2 and connect all equipment when connecting to guider and PHD2 is not running</li>
<li>Adaptive Cooling: Duration for cool/warm camera is now a minimum duration. In case the cooler cannot keep up with the set duration, the application will wait for the camera to reach the checkpoints instead of just continuing setting new targets without the camera having any chance to reach those in the timeframe.</li>
</ul>
