    <h1 id="version-1.9">Version 1.9</h1>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<h3 id="dither-without-guiding">Dither without guiding</h3>
<ul>
<li>A new Direct Guider has been added, which doesn't require a guide camera. It can only perform random dithers. It connects directly to the telescope, and will if required perform a dither via a Pulse Guide of a user-provided duration in a random direction.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Added interface for ASTAP, the Astrometric STAcking Program, astrometric solver and FITS viewer as a plate solver</li>

<li>Attempt to start PHD2 and connect all equipment when connecting to guider and PHD2 is not running</li>
<li>Adaptive Cooling: Duration for cool/warm camera is now a minimum duration. In case the cooler cannot keep up with the set duration, the application will wait for the camera to reach the checkpoints instead of just continuing setting new targets without the camera having any chance to reach those in the timeframe.</li>

<li>Improved XISF save speed and resulting file size by not embedding the image as base64 string, but instead as attached raw byte data</li>
<li>Additional FITS keywords are now added to images if their associated data is available:
<ul>
<li><code>OBJECT</code>: The name of the target, as supplied in the active Sequence</li>
<li><code>DEC</code> and <code>RA</code>: The DEC and RA of the telescope at the time of the exposure</li>
<li><code>INSTRUME</code>: The name of the connected camera</li>
<li><code>OFFSET</code>: The sensor offset, if applicable</li>
<li><code>FWHEEL</code>: Name of the connected filter wheel</li>
<li><code>FOCNAME</code>: Name of the connected focuser</li>

<li><code>FOCTEMP</code> and <code>FOCUSTEM</code>: Temperature reported by the focuser</li>
<li><code>ROTNAME</code> Name of the connected rotator</li>
<li><code>ROTATOR</code> and <code>ROTATANG</code>: Angle of the rotator</li>
